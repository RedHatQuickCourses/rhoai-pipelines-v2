== Data Science Pipeline Concepts

 . Pipeline - is a workflow definition containing the steps and their input and output artifacts.

 . Run - is a single execution of a pipeline. A run can be a one off execution of a pipeline, or pipelines can be scheduled as a recurring run.

 . Task - is a self-contained pipeline component that represents an execution stage in the pipeline.

 . Artifact - Steps have the ability to create artifacts, which are objects that can be persisted after the execution of the step completes. Other steps may use those artifacts as inputs and some artifacts may be useful references after a pipeline run has completed. Artifacts automatically stored by Data Science Pipelines in S3 compatible storage.

 . Experiment - is a logical grouping of runs for the purpose of comparing different pipelines

 . Execution -  is an instance of a Task/Component
