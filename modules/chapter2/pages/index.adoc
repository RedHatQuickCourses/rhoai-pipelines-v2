=== Configuring a pipeline server

Before you can successfully create a pipeline in OpenShift AI, you must configure a pipeline server. This task includes configuring where your pipeline artifacts and data are stored.
 
 * You have an existing S3-compatible object storage bucket and you have configured write access to your S3 bucket on your storage account. 
 * You have created a data science project that you can add a pipeline server to.
 * By default in RHOAI when a pipeline server is created it deploys a namespace mariaDB.
 * If you are configuring a pipeline server with an external database.
 ** Red Hat recommends that you use MySQL version 8.x.
 ** Red Hat recommends that you use at least MariaDB version 10.5.
