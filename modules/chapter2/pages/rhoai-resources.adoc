Navigate to the Data Science Project section of the OpenShift AI Console / Dashboard. Select the fraud-detection project.  

//image::create_workbench.png[width=640]

 . Select the WorkBench button, then click create workbench

 .. Name:  `fraud-detection`

 .. Notebook Image:  `TensorFlow`

 .. Deployment Size:  select medium (small if working with limited resources)

 .. Scroll to the bottom, check the `Use data connection box`.
 
 .. Select *my-storage* from the dropdown to attach the storage bucket to the workbench.  

 . Select the Create Workbench.

[NOTE]
Depending on the notebook image selected and the deployment size, it can take between 2-20 minutes for the container image to be fully deployed. The Open Link will be available when our container is fully deployed.  



== Lab Exercise: Access JupyterLab


JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. For a demonstration of JupyterLab and its features, https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html#what-will-happen-to-the-classic-notebook[you can view this video., window=_blank]


Return to the `fraud-detection` workbench dashboard in the OpenShift AI console.

 . Select the *Open* link to the right of the status section of the fraud-detection workbench
+
 . When the new window opens, use the OpenShift admin user & password to login to JupyterLab. 

 . A landing page will prompt for Access Authorization. Make sure the boxes are checked for:
 .. user:info
 .. user:check-access
 . Click the *Allow selected permissions* button to complete login to the notebook.


[NOTE]
If the *OPEN* link for the notebook is grayed out, the notebook container is still starting. This process can take a few minutes & up to 20+ minutes depending on the notebook image / resources we opted to choose.


== Lab Exercise: Working with files in JupyterLab

This takes us to the JupyterLab screen where we can select multiple options / tools / to work to begin our data science experimentation.

Our first action is to clone a git repository that contains notebooks including an sample notebook to familize yourself with the Jupiter notebook environment.

[NOTE]
```yaml
https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/fraud-detection.git
```


 . Copy the URL link above

 . Click on the Clone a Repo Icon above explorer section window.

 . Paste the link into the *clone a repo* pop up,   make sure the *included submodules are checked*, then click the clone.
 
 . Navigate to the `fraud-detection` folder:

 . Then open the file: 0_sandbox.ipynb

 . Follow the directions in the notebook to explore Jupyter.
