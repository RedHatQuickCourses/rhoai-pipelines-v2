|When developing a pipeline, depending on the tool, users may generate a YAML based PipelineRun object that is then uploaded into the Dashboard to create an executable pipeline.  Even though this yaml object is a valid Tekton PipelineRun it is intended to be uploaded to the Dashboard, and not applied directly to the cluster.

|Pipeline Runs
|pipelineruns.tekton.dev
|Yes
|A pipeline can be executed in a number of different ways, including from the Dashboard, which will result in the creation of a pipelinerun.
