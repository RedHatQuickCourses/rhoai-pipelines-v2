== Deploy MinIO as S3 compatible storage

=== MinIO overview

*MinIO* is a high-performance, S3-compatible object store. It can be deployed on a wide variety of platforms, and it comes in multiple flavors.

This segment describes a very quick way of deploying the community version of MinIO in order to quickly setup a fully standalone Object Store, in an OpenShift Cluster. This can then be used for various prototyping tasks that require Object Storage.

[WARNING]
This version of MinIO should not be used in production-grade environments. Additionally, MinIO is not included in RHOAI, and Red Hat does not provide support for MinIO.

== MinIO Deployment

To Deploy MinIO, we will utilize the OpenShift Dashboard. 

image::minio_install.gif[width=600]

 . Then Select the + (plus) icon from the top right of the dashboard.

 .  In the new window, we will paste the following YAML file.  In the YAML below its recommended to change the default user name & password. 

 . Click on the Project Selection list dropdown and select the "fraud-detection" project or the data science project you created in the previous step.

*This should finish in a few seconds. Now it's time to deploy our storage buckets.*

== MinIO Storage Bucket Creation



image::minio_setup.gif[width=600]

From the OCP Dashboard:

 . Select Networking / Routes from the navigation menu. 
 
 . This will display two routes, one for the UI & another for the API.  (if the routes are not visible, make sure you have the project selected that matches your data sicence project created earlier)


 . For the first step, select the UI route and paste it or open in a new browser tab or window.

 . If you see a landing page with the message *application not available*, refresh the page a few times as the service is still loading.
  
 . The displayed page is the MinIO Dashboard. Log in with the username/password combination you set, or the defaults listed below.

 .. username = minio

 .. password = minio321!

Once logged into the MinIO Console:

  . Click Create Bucket to get started.

  . Create two Buckets: 

   ..  *pipelines* 

   ..  *my-storage*

   ..  *models* (optional) 


This completes the pre-work to configure the data scicence pipeline lab environment. With our S3 Compatible storage ready to go, let's head to next section of the course and learn more about DSP concepts.
