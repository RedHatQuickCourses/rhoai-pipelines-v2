= Lab Environment

== OpenShift Container Cluster Platform (OCP) Environment

We will use the https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fopenshift-cnv.ocpmulti-wksp-cnv.prod[*Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cluster (AWS)*, window=_blank] catalog item in the Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP) to run the hands-on exercises in this course.

[TIP]
The lab environment on average takes ~40-60 minutes to enter the ready state.  While your lab environment is provisioning, I recommend that you read through the course once, then return and complete the lab portions once your *OpenShift Container Cluster Platform* environment is ready to go.

When ordering this catalog item in RHDP:

  . Select Practice/Enablement for the Activity field

  . Select Learning about the Product for the Purpose field

  . Leave the Salesforce ID field blank

  . Scroll to the bottom, read the usage cost section, then check the box to confirm acceptance of terms and conditions

  . Click order

For Red Hat partners who do not have access to RHDP, you need to provision an OpenShift AI cluster on-premises, or in the supported cloud environments by following the product documentation at https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.12/html/installing_and_uninstalling_openshift_ai_self-managed/index[Product Documentation for installing Red Hat OpenShift AI 2.12, window=_blank].

The OCP environment will provide the foundation infrastructure for Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI). Once logged into the OCP dashboard, we need to install the Operators to enable RHOAI components in the OCP platform.

== Operators and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Operators automate the creation, configuration, and management of instances of Kubernetes-native applications. Operators provide automation at every level of the stackâ€”from managing the parts that make up the platform all the way to applications that are provided as a managed service. In addition to the automation advantages of Operators for managing the platform, Red Hat OpenShift makes it easier to find, install, and manage Operators running on your clusters.

Included in Red Hat OpenShift is the Embedded OperatorHub, a registry of certified Operators from software vendors and open source projects. Within the Embedded OperatorHub you can browse and install a library of Operators that have been verified to work with Red Hat OpenShift and that have been packaged for easy lifecycle management.

== Lab Exercise: Installation of Red Hat OpenShift AI

This section will discuss the process for installing the dependent operators using the OpenShift Web Console. ( ~15 minutes )

IMPORTANT: The installation requires a user with the _cluster-admin_ role

This exercise uses the Red Hat Demo Platform; specifically the OpenShift Container Cluster Platform Resource.  If you haven't already you'll need to launch the lab environment before continuing. 

. Login to the Red Hat OpenShift using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.

. Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and search for each of the following Operators individually. For this lab you can skip the installation of the optional operators.

[*] You do not have to wait for the previous Operator to complete before installing the next. For this lab you can skip the installation of the optional operators as there is no accelerator required.

[TIP]
 
 Installing these Operators prior to the installation of the OpenShift AI Operator in my experience has made a difference in OpenShift AI acknowledging the availability of these components and adjusting the initial configuration to shift management of these components to OpenShift AI. 

== Installation of Red Hat OpenShift AI Operator

image::openshiftai_install.gif[width=600]
