<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A machine learning pipeline is a crucial component in the development and productionization of machine learning systems, helping data scientists and data engineers manage the complexity of the end-to-end machine learning process and helping them to develop accurate and scalable solutions for a wide range of applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Machine learning (ML) pipelines are a key part of the data science process, helping data scientists to streamline their work and automate tasks. They can make the model development process more efficient and reproducible, while also reducing the risk of errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Modularization:</strong> Pipelines enable you to break down the machine learning process into modular, well-defined steps. Each step can be developed, tested and optimized independently, making it easier to manage and maintain the workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> Machine learning pipelines make it easier to reproduce experiments. By defining the sequence of steps and their parameters in a pipeline, you can recreate the entire process exactly, ensuring consistent results. If a step fails or a model&#8217;s performance deteriorates, the pipeline can be configured to raise alerts or take corrective actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Experimentation:</strong> You can experiment with different data preprocessing techniques, feature selections, and models by modifying individual steps within the pipeline. This flexibility enables for rapid iteration and optimization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Pipelines make it easier for teams of data scientists and engineers to collaborate. Since the workflow is structured and documented, it&#8217;s easier for team members to understand and contribute to the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Version control and documentation:</strong> You can use version control systems to track changes in your pipeline&#8217;s code and configuration, ensuring that you can roll back to previous versions if needed. A well-structured pipeline encourages better documentation of each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Machine learning lifecycles can vary in complexity and may involve additional steps depending on the use case, such as hyperparameter optimization, cross-validation, and feature selection. The goal of a machine learning pipeline is to automate and standardize these processes, making it easier to develop and maintain ML models for various applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integration with DevOps (2010s): Machine learning pipelines started to be integrated with DevOps practices to enable continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of machine learning models. This integration emphasized the need for reproducibility, version control and monitoring in ML pipelines. This integration is referred to as machine learning operations, or MLOps, which helps data science teams effectively manage the complexity of managing ML orchestration. In a real-time deployment, the pipeline replies to a request within milliseconds of the request.</p>

<p><strong>Pipeline</strong> - is a workflow definition containing the steps and their input and output artifacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run</strong> - is a single execution of a pipeline. A run can be a one off execution of a pipeline, or pipelines can be scheduled as a recurring run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task</strong> - is a self-contained pipeline component that represents an execution stage in the pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artifact</strong> - Steps have the ability to create artifacts, which are objects that can be persisted after the execution of the step completes. Other steps may use those artifacts as inputs and some artifacts may be useful references after a pipeline run has completed. Artifacts automatically stored by Data Science Pipelines in S3 compatible storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment</strong> - is a logical grouping of runs for the purpose of comparing different pipelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution</strong> -  is an instance of a Task/Component</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A data science pipeline is typically implemented to improve the repeatability of a data science experiment.  While the larger experimentation process may include steps such as data exploration, where data scientists seek to create a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of the data, data science pipelines tend to focus on turning a viable experiment into a repeatable solution that can be iterated on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A data science pipeline, may also fit within the context of a larger pipeline that manages the complete lifecycle of an application, and the data science pipeline is responsible for the process of training the machine learning model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data science pipelines may consists of several key activities that are performed in a structured sequence to train a machine learning model. These activities may include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Gathering the data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, spreadsheets, or external datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Cleaning</strong>: Identifying and handling missing or inconsistent data, removing duplicates, and addressing data quality issues to ensure that the data is reliable and ready for analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Creating or transforming features (variables) to improve the performance of machine learning models. This may involve scaling, one-hot encoding, creating new variables, or reducing dimensionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Preparing the data for modeling, which may involve standardizing, normalizing, or scaling the data. This step is crucial for machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of features.  This step may also include splitting the data into multiple subsets of data including a test and train dataset to allow the model to be validated using data the trained model has never seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Training</strong>: After the data has been split into an appropriate subset, the model is trained using the training dataset.  As part of the training process, the machine learning algorithm will generally iterate through the training data, making adjustments to the model until it arrives at the "best" version of the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: The model performance is assessed with the previously unseen test dataset using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or mean squared error. Cross-validation techniques may be used to ensure the model&#8217;s robustness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A single pipeline may include the ability to train multiple models, complete complex hyperparameter searches, or more.  Data Scientists can use a well crafted pipeline to quickly iterate on a model, adjust how data is transformed, test different algorithms, and more.  While the steps described above describe a common pattern for model training, different use cases and projects may have vastly different requirements and the tools and framework selected for creating a data science pipeline should help to enable a flexible design.</p>
